Information technology engineering (ITE) involves an architectural approach for planning, analyzing, designing, and implementing applications. ITE has been defined by Steven M Davis as: "An integrated and evolutionary set of tasks and techniques that enhance business communication throughout an enterprise enabling it to develop people, procedures and systems to achieve its vision".[citation needed]

ITE has many purposes, including organization planning, business re-engineering, application development, information systems planning, and systems re-engineering. ITE can be used to analyze, design, and implement data structures in an enterprise. The goal of ITE is to allow for a business to improve the way it manages its resources such as capital, people, and information systems to achieve its business goals. The importance of ITE and its concepts have increased rapidly with the growth of current technology. ITE assumes that logical data representations are stable; which is the opposite to the processes that use the data, which constantly change. This allows for the logical data model, which reflects an organization's ideas, to be the basis for systems development.
